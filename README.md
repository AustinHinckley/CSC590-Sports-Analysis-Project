# CSC590-Sports-Analysis-Project

This project is a graphical user interface for plotting baseball hitting stats. The interface contains dropdown menus
to filter results based on year ranges, teams, or players on a team. When the user clicks Plot, a scatter plot will
appear below the menus with a correlation coefficient to dictate how well the chosen stats are related.

There are basically three modes:
1. Getting stat totals for a specified player on a specified team in a range of years (separate data points for each year)
2. Getting stat totals for a ALL players on a specified team in a range of years (separate data points for each year)
3. Getting stat totals for ALL players on ALL teams in a range of years (separate data points for each team-year pair)
